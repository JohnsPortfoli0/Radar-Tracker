# Radar Tracker
This project implements a radar signal filtering and tracking system designed to estimate the true state of a moving target in the presence of noise. The tracker is built in MATLAB and Simulink and utilizes a Kalman filter to smooth noisy radar measurements, predict future positions, and improve accuracy compared to raw sensor data.
