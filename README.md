# Radar Tracker
This project implements a radar signal filtering and tracking system designed to estimate the true state of a moving target in the presence of noise. The tracker is built in MATLAB and Simulink and utilizes a Kalman filter to smooth noisy radar measurements, predict future positions, and improve accuracy compared to raw sensor data.

# Steps for Running the Script Properly
Please download the "RadarTracker.m" file under "Project Items"

1. Open "RadarTracker.m" in MATLAB
   
2. Run the script and observe the plots
   
   Figure 1: Plots the true position of the target as well as the noisy measurements  
   Figure 2: Shows a manual Kalman filter vs. MATLABs Kalman filter command  
   Figure 3: Shows combination Figure 1 and 2
